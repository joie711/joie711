## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Joie, a budding software developer currently enrolled in a 14-week immersive program with TechElevator. I decided to pursue software development because it engages my mind and critical thinking skills in a way that was missing in my previous roles in health care administration.

### What I'm Learning

* **Java:** Building a strong foundation in object-oriented programming.
* **Client-Server Programming:** Working with SQL and HTTP to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
* **Web Development:** Developing web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Background

I hold a BA in Psychology and Spanish from Gonzaga University. My background in psychology helps me approach problems with empathy and understanding, while my language skills enhance my communication and documentation abilities. 

### Goals and Aspirations
I'm excited to work on projects that challenge me and allow me to apply my new skills. My long-term goal is to contribute to impactful projects and collaborate with other passionate developers in the tech community.

### Hobbies and Interests
When I'm not coding, you can find me reading fantasy/Sci-fi books and playing board games with friends! I also try to spend as much time as I can outdoors with my dog, Bean, hiking the trails along the river.

Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me!
